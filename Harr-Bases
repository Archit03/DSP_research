'''
The Equivalence between the space of M * N matrices and R^mn can we
easily define the inner product between 2 matrices in the usual way 

⟨A,B⟩= 
M−1  N-1
∑    ∑ (a_m,n)⟨b_m,n⟩
M=0  n=0 
we take inner product between 2 matrices as the,
standard inner product of their unrolled versions.
The inner product allows us to define orthogonality between images,
and this is rather useful since we're going to explore a 
couple of bases for this space.
